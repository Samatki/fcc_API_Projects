#API01: Timestamp Microservice

##FCC Back End Development - API Projects

Project developed on c9.io then uploaded to heroku.

1. User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

2. User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

3. User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
